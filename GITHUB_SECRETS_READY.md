# üöÄ GitHub Secrets Setup - Complete & Ready

## Summary of Files Cleanup

### ‚úÖ KEPT (Working & Clean):
- **`SETUP_GITHUB_SECRETS.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- **`scripts/github-secrets-info.sh`** - Simple helper script to display required secrets

### ‚ùå REMOVED (Broken/Redundant):
- `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh` - Had variable extraction issues
- `scripts/complete-setup.sh` - Overly complex and had execution problems
- `scripts/configure-github-secrets.sh` - Failed to execute properly

## üéØ Next Steps for GitHub Secrets Configuration

### 1. Generate Railway Token
- Go to: https://railway.app/account/tokens
- Click "Create New Token"
- Name it: `GitHub Actions - MifosX`
- Copy the generated token

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to: https://github.com/MYKLCS/MifosX/settings/secrets/actions

Add these 3 secrets:
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` = [Your generated token]
- `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_PROJECT_ID` = `71e46957-dc0f-4e52-80ba-f1edb3e11666`
- `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_SERVICE_ID` = `a2567a8b-16bc-4089-b82b-ec7547450707`

### 3. Test Deployment
```bash
# Make a test change
echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md

# Commit and push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Watch: https://github.com/MYKLCS/MifosX/actions
- Check: https://mifosx-production.up.railway.app

## ‚úÖ Status: Ready for Automated Deployment

Your Railway deployment setup is now clean and ready. Once you configure the GitHub secrets, every push to the `main` branch will automatically deploy your MifosX application to Railway.
